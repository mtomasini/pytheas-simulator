# About testing

The tests for the Map object are only done locally and are not part of the automatic testing. This is because they require the download of data from my harddrive, and I don't think it would be worth it to upload any data to this repository. At a later stage I planning on creating a pipeline to download data from Copernicus' website while running Pytheas.

Note: as of May 2025, some testing is missing as I have needed to step up development speed and it came at the cost of testing. I am truly sorry about this, but I will add testing functionalities as soon as possible.
