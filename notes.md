# Notes for the development of Pytheas

- For testing and structuring of the code, I'm using [this](https://docs.python-guide.org/) reference.
- Later, to create the file `requirements.txt`, use `pip install pipreqs` (see [here](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs)). It creates the requirements file based on the imports of the project.
- I am testing using `pytest`
